# Your Personal AI Assistant for Google Calendar

Tired of juggling calendar invites and finding the perfect meeting time? This is an AI-powered assistant designed to manage your Google Calendar for you. Think of it as a smart, automated layer on top of your schedule that understands what you want, just from a simple text message.

Originally built as a personal tool, it’s now a powerful service ready to save you time and eliminate scheduling headaches.

## How It Works

Our assistant connects securely to your Google Calendar and works through a simple chat interface on **Telegram**. You just talk to it like you would a human assistant, and it handles the rest.

- **Connect:** Securely link your Google Calendar account.
- **Chat:** Open Telegram and tell your assistant what you need.
- **Done:** Your calendar is instantly updated, and conflicts are handled for you.

## What You Can Do with It

### Effortless Scheduling with Plain English

- **Create Events Naturally:** Just say, _"Schedule a call with Sarah for tomorrow at 3 PM"_ or _"Block out my morning for deep work."_ No more clicking through menus.
- **Smart Updates & Deletes:** Easily change or cancel events with commands like, _"Move my 3 PM call to Friday"_ or _"Cancel my meeting with the marketing team."_

### Intelligent Features That Save You Time

- **Find the Perfect Time:** The assistant can look at multiple calendars to find a time that works for everyone.
- **Automatic Conflict Resolution:** If a new event clashes with an existing one, the assistant will notify you and suggest alternative times.
- **Detailed Event Management:** It understands all the important details—add guests, set email or pop-up reminders, create recurring meetings, and set event privacy (public or private).

### Your Calendar, Your Way

- **Works with All Your Calendars:** It can see and manage all your connected Google Calendars, whether for work, personal life, or specific projects.
- **Knows Your Timezone:** The assistant automatically detects and handles different timezones, so you never have to do the math for international meetings again.

## What Makes It Smart?

Our system uses a team of specialized AI "agents" that work together behind the scenes. When you send a request, these agents collaborate to:

1.  **Understand** what you mean.
2.  **Verify** the details (like checking if guests are available).
3.  **Take Action** on your calendar.

This multi-agent approach allows it to handle even complex scheduling tasks with precision and speed.

## Built for Security and Reliability

- **Private & Secure:** Your calendar data is yours alone. We use secure methods to store your connection tokens and protect your information.
- **Ready to Scale:** The system is built on a robust and modern foundation, ensuring it’s reliable whether you're managing a personal schedule or a team's entire workflow.
- **Payment-Ready:** With Stripe integration, it's ready to handle subscriptions for future SaaS features.
